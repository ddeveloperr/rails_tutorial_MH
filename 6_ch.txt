6.4.1 What we learned in this chapter

    Migrations allow us to modify our applicationâ€™s data model.
    
    Active Record comes with a large number of methods for creating and manipulating data models.
    
    Active Record validations allow us to place constraints on the data in our models.
    
    Common validations include presence, length, and format.
    
    Regular expressions are cryptic but powerful.
    
    Defining a database index improves lookup efficiency while allowing enforcement of uniqueness at the database level.
    
    We can add a secure password to a model using the built-in has_secure_password method.
