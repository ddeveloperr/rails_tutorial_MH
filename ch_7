    The form_for helper is used to make forms for interacting with Active Record objects.
    Signup failure renders the new user page and displays error messages automatically determined by Active Record.
    Rails provides the flash as a standard way to display temporary messages.
    Signup success creates a user in the database and redirects to the user show page, and displays a welcome message.
