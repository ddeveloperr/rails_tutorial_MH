8. What we learned in this chapter

    Rails can maintain state from one page to the next using both temporary and persistent cookies.
    The login form is designed to create a new session to log a user in.
    The flash.now method is used for flash messages on rendered pages.
    Test-driven development is useful when debugging by reproducing the bug in a test.
    Using the session method, we can securely place a user id on the browser to create a temporary session.
    We can change features such as links on the layouts based on login status.
    Integration tests can verify correct routes, database updates, and proper changes to the layout.
    We associate to each user a remember token and a corresponding remember digest for use in persistent sessions.
    Using the cookies method, we create a persistent session by placing a permanent remember token cookie on the browser.
    Login status is determined by the presence of a current user based on the temporary session’s user id or the permanent session’s unique remember token.
    The application signs users out by deleting the session’s user id and removing the permanent cookie from the browser.
    The ternary operator is a compact way to write simple if-then statements.
