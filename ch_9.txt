9.5.1 What we learned in this chapter

    Users can be updated using an edit form, which sends a PATCH request to the update action.
    Safe updating through the web is enforced using strong parameters.
    Before filters give a standard way to run methods before particular controller actions.
    We implement an authorization using before filters.
    Authorization tests use both low-level commands to submit particular HTTP requests directly to controller actions and high-level integration tests.
    Friendly forwarding redirects users where they wanted to go after logging in.
    The users index page shows all users, one page at a time.
    Rails uses the standard file db/seeds.rb to seed the database with sample data using rake db:seed.
    Running render @users automatically calls the _user.html.erb partial on each user in the collection.
    A boolean attribute admin on users automatically gives a user.admin? boolean method.
    Admins can delete users through the web by clicking on delete links that issue DELETE requests to the Users controller destroy action.
    We can create a large number of test users using embedded Ruby inside fixtures.
